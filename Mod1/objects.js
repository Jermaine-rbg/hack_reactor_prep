// In real life, a car is an object

// A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:

// An object is a collection of properties

// A property is an association between a name (key) and a value (some data type)

// A property's value can be any of the types we have gone over, as well as being another object, or even a function

// In the case where the value of a property is a function, we refer to the property as a method

// first let us look at an object with boolean values

var booleanObj = {
    isObject: true,
    isString: false
};

// next, let us look at an object with number values

var numbersObj = {
    count: 4,
    remaining: 7
};

// finally, let us look at an object with string values

var stringObj = {
    name: 'Daisy',
    currentTitle: 'pupper',
    futurePosition: 'doggo'
}
