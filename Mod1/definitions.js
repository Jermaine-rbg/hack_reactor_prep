// Parameters are variables listed as a part of the function definition.

// Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.

// The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

// Fixed values are called Literals.

// Variable values are called Variables.

// Numbers are written with or without decimals:

// Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:

// In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

// JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

// An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

// JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:

// JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:

// JavaScript variables can hold different data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:

// JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:

// JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:

// JavaScript has only one type of numbers.

// Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

// Booleans can only have two values: true or false

// Booleans are often used in conditional testing.

// JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

// Array items are separated by commas.

// Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.

// JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}

// Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

// You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.

// The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:

// In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.

// Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.
