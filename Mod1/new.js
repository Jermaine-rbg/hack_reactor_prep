//Getting stuck in the middle of the technical interview/technical admissions assessment can be tricky. Here are some tips on how to get unstuck.

// Keep trying different strategies.
// Stay open to creative ideas.
// Try not to get frustrated.

// Break the problem into simpler parts.
// Analyze the parts of the problem.
// Concentrate on the parts of the problem you understand and that can be solved.
// Solve each piece by itself.

// Rubber ducking
// Verbalize the problem to yourself and others.

// what the problem is
// what you have done
// where you are stuck

// Re-describe the problem.
// Think of simpler ways to describe the problem

// This is sometimes called "rubber-ducking" because there is an anecdote about an engineer who would keep a rubber duck (like what little kids use in the bathtub at his desk. When he got stuck, he would talk it over with his duck.

// Look for hidden assumptions or information you have forgotten to use.
// After reading each phrase or sentence of the problem statement, ask yourself if any assumptions can be inferred from that phrase.
// Check again to make sure you are solving the right problem.
// Double-check all of your values, assumptions, and approaches. Make sure you haven't missed anything and that you are looking for the correct solution.

// Re-evaluate your strategy
// Try using a different strategy. There is usually more than one way to solve a problem, and you may find a method that you haven't considered is much easier than the one you're working on currently.

// Consider a different core data structure.
// Consider a different algorithm a different way of processing the data
// Consider using different helper functions different built-in JavaScript methods, say

// Be the interpreter
// Walk through your code as though you were the interpreter.
// To "be the interpreter" means to evaluate every small step in a section of code. And by "evaluating", we mean actually evaluating the code all the way down to the literal value which are the end result of evaluation.
// console.log statements can help as well, but make sure to use them precisely.
// Then, when you see the concrete output, it's a lot easier to realize what is wrong.
