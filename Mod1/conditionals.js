// What is Pseudocode?
// We have seen it before
// English language statements that describe what the code will do
// Should be structured similarly to the way the eventual code will be (indentation, etc.)
// Each line of pseudocode should correspond to one line of actual code

// A conditional that allows your program to do something, if some condition is true
// Armed with an if statement, this is easily translatable into code:

var rollinSixOwe = true;

if (rollinSixOwe === true) {
  console.log("you cripping");
}
