// What is an Operator?

// An operator is used to perform specific computations or operations on operands

// We have seen a few so far: =,+, -, and typeof

// They can be unary: {operator} {operand} (e.g. typeof "username"), or:

// They can be binary: {operand1} {operator} {operand2} (e.g. 4 + 5)

// What is a Method?

// A method is a function that is a property of an object

// We have seen a few so far: console.log, and Array.isArray()

// A few details about console.log and Expressions as Arguments

// console.log() is a method (a function that is a property of an object)

// When we call console.log() we will typically pass it an argument, or sometimes several arguments, where each argument is separated by commas

// The commas are also operators
