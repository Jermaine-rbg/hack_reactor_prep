// What is an Operator?

// An operator is used to perform specific computations or operations on operands

// We have seen a few so far: =,+, -, and typeof

// They can be unary: {operator} {operand} (e.g. typeof "username"), or:

// They can be binary: {operand1} {operator} {operand2} (e.g. 4 + 5)

// What is a Method?

// A method is a function that is a property of an object

// We have seen a few so far: console.log, and Array.isArray()

// A few details about console.log and Expressions as Arguments

// console.log() is a method (a function that is a property of an object)

// When we call console.log() we will typically pass it an argument, or sometimes several arguments, where each argument is separated by commas

// The commas are also operators

// In a few cases of calling console.log, we said something like:

console.log('some message:', typeof {a: 1});

// To be sure, we are calling this function, console.log, with two arguments. The first is a string:

// 'some message:'

// and the second is an operator applied to an object:

// This second argument is an example of calling a function with an expression as an argument. Before the function runs, the expression is "evaluated". typeof {a: 1} evaluates to "object", thus the resulting message when this code is run in the console. Let us keep this concept in mind as we proceed through the material.

// Expressions assigned to a Variable

// One thing we have already been doing, is assigning the result of an expression to a variable, using =; which is an assignment operator. Let us do so now:

var typeOfOperand = typeof {a: 1};
console.log('some message:', typeOfOperand);
